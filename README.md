Installing
==========

This program requires Python 3.8 or newer. The simplest way to perform the installation is to use a virtual environment to isolate its dependencies. To install from source after cloning this repository:

```bash
make install-dependencies
```

This will install this library and all of its dependencies into the current Python environment. The command line tool will be made available under the name `glycresoft`.

If you want to build the standalone executable that bundles all of its dependencies with its own version of Python, next run

```bash
pip install PyInstaller
make build-pyinstaller
```

This will install PyInstaller, a Python program which can package another Python program and all of its dependencies into a native executable, and run it on an entry point wrapper for GlycReSoft. Afterwards, the standalone executable and its static files are located in `./pyinstaller/dist/glycresoft-cli/`, where the executable is named `glycresoft-cli`, which will operate essentially the same as the `glycresoft` executable installed above, save that it will do some platform specific configuration and can be used from outside the virtual environment it was created in.
